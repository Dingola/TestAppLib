## [Description]
A Qt 6 Widgets project.

This project was generated from a template for creating Qt-based applications. The solution
is divided into two parts: the main project and a test project. By default, only the 
main project is built. The test project can be built if desired, controlled by a CMake 
boolean variable `<PROJECT_NAME>_BUILD_TEST_PROJECT`. Additionally, the CMake variable 
`<PROJECT_NAME>_BUILD_TARGET_TYPE` must be set to `static_library` for the test project 
to be executed.

The template provides a minimal starting point for Qt applications, supports documentation 
generation with Doxygen, and includes GitHub workflows (CI builds) for both Linux and Windows.

## 🔐 Tokens for GitHub Actions

Some workflows in this repository require tokens to function correctly. Below are the details for the required tokens and how to configure them.

### 1. Codecov Token (Required for Code Coverage)

The **CODECOV_TOKEN** is required to upload code coverage reports to [Codecov](https://codecov.io). This token ensures that only authorized users can upload coverage data for your repository.

#### How to create the Codecov Token:

1. Go to your repository on [Codecov](https://codecov.io).
2. Navigate to **Settings → Repository → Upload Token**.
3. Copy the generated token.

### 2. Personal Access Token (PAT) [Optional]

The **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is only required for the disabled workflows in this repository. These workflows are kept for reference and are not actively used in the CI/CD pipeline.

#### How to create the PAT:

1. Go to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **“Generate new token (classic)”**.
3. Set a name (e.g., `Legacy CI Token`) and expiration date.
4. Under **Scopes**, check:
   - `repo`
5. Click **“Generate token”** and copy the token immediately.

### Adding Tokens as Repository Secrets

Once you have generated the required tokens, add them as secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to:
   **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**
3. Add the following secrets:
   - **For Codecov**:
     - **Name**: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
     - **Secret**: *(paste the Codecov token)*
   - **For Disabled Workflows**:
     - **Name**: `PAT_TOKEN`
     - **Secret**: *(paste the PAT token)*

> **Note**: The `CODECOV_TOKEN` is required for the `build_and_test_linux.yml` workflow to upload coverage reports. The `PAT_TOKEN` is only needed for the disabled workflows.

<br>

### 2) Setting up
```
git clone https://github.com/Dingola/TestAppLib.git
cd TestAppLib/
```
<br>

---
<br>

### 3) Configuring and Building
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure CMake can find Qt by setting `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your Qt install, for example: `..\Qt\6.8.0\msvc2022_64`
```
cmake -B _build -S . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Qt\6.8.0\msvc2022_64"
cd _build
cmake --build . --config Release
```
<br>

---
<br>

### 4) Run the project

```
cd QT_Project/Release/
./TestAppLib.exe
```

<br>

---
<br>

### 5) Deployment
The project includes scripts for building, testing and deploying the application. These scripts are located in the `Scripts` directory, organized by platform (e.g., `Win` for Windows, `Linux` for Linux).

- **build_release.sh:** Builds the project in release mode.
- **build_and_run_tests.sh:** Builds and runs the test project.
- **build_and_deploy.sh:** Builds and deploys the project. This script can also create a ZIP archive of the deployment directory and/or an NSIS installer using the `installer.nsi` script (Windows only).

To create a ZIP archive of the deployment directory, set `BUILD_ZIP_ARCHIVE` to `true` in `build_and_deploy.sh`.

To create an NSIS installer (Windows only), set `BUILD_NSIS_INSTALLER` to `true` in `build_and_deploy.sh`.
<br><br>

---
<br>

### 6) Using Docker

#### 1. Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the following command:
```
docker build -t testapplib-dockerimage .
```
<br>

#### 2. Ways to Run the Docker Image
- **Run directly:**
```
docker run testapplib-dockerimage
```
- **Start an interactive Bash shell:**
```
docker run -it testapplib-dockerimage bash
```
<br>

#### 3. Run the App or Tests in the Container

- **Start the app (virtual display with Xvfb):**
```
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 -nolisten tcp & export DISPLAY=:99 && ./_build_app_release/QT_Project/TestAppLib
```

- **Run the tests (virtual display with Xvfb):**
```
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 -nolisten tcp & export DISPLAY=:99 && ./_build_tests_release/QT_Project_Tests/TestAppLib_Tests
```
<br>

#### 4. Display GUI on the Host Machine (Windows)
1. Download and install **VcXsrv Windows X Server**: [Download VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
2. Configure VcXsrv:
   - Select **Multiple windows** and set **Display number** to `99`.
   - Choose **Start no client**.
   - Enable **Disable access control**.
   - Alternatively, use the preconfigured `config.xlaunch` file located in the `Configs` folder of this project. Double-click the file to launch VcXsrv with the correct settings.
3. Start the Docker container:
```
docker run -it --name testapplib-container --network host -e DISPLAY=<IP-ADDRESS>:99.0 -e TERM=xterm-256color -e QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 testapplib-dockerimage bash
```
> [!NOTE]
> Replace `<IP-ADDRESS>` with the host's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.2`). Do not use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.

4. Inside the container:

- **Start the app:**
```
"./_build_app_release/QT_Project/TestAppLib"
```

- **Run the tests:**
```
"./_build_tests_release/QT_Project_Tests/TestAppLib_Tests"
```
<br>

#### 5. Note on Display Number
- The display number in the `DISPLAY` variable is **99.0**, not `99`.
- You can verify this in the VcXsrv logs. Look for a line like:
```
winClipboardThreadProc - DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:99.0
```
- Ensure the `DISPLAY` variable is set correctly, e.g.:
```
export DISPLAY=192.168.1.2:99.0
```
<br>

#### 6. Additional Notes
- Ensure the firewall on the host allows connections to the X11 server (VcXsrv).
- If the GUI does not display, check the `DISPLAY` variable and the VcXsrv logs.
<br><br><br>

## Creating Releases

The repository includes a release workflow for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It starts
when a semantic version tag is pushed:

```text
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
v2.0.0-beta.1
```

Create and push a stable release tag:

```powershell
git status
```

```powershell
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
```

```powershell
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The Git working tree should be clean and the tagged commit should already have passed
the normal build-and-test workflows.

The release workflow creates a draft, tests the tagged revision, and builds all native
packages. Assets are uploaded directly to the GitHub Release without using GitHub
Actions artifact storage. The release is published only after all platform jobs
succeed. If a job fails, the draft remains available for inspection.


The workflow creates:

- `TestAppLib-<VERSION>-windows-x64.zip`
- `TestAppLib-<VERSION>-windows-x64-installer.exe`
- `TestAppLib-<VERSION>-linux-x86_64.AppImage`
- `TestAppLib-<VERSION>-macos-<ARCH>.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`


The tag supplies the version to CMake as `MAIN_PROJECT_VERSION`. CMake then populates
`PROJECT_VERSION`, its major/minor/patch components, the configured `Config.h`, library
metadata, package configuration, installer metadata, and release filenames.

Pre-release tags containing a suffix, such as `v2.0.0-beta.1`, are published as GitHub
pre-releases.

The workflow requires `contents: write` for its repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN`. No
personal access token is required. Unsigned Windows and macOS packages may trigger
operating-system security warnings; code signing and Apple notarization can be added
later with repository secrets.

## [Translations]
The project includes custom targets for updating and compiling translation files. These targets are defined in the CMake file located in `TestAppLib/QT_Project` and can be used to manage translation files located in the `TestAppLib/QT_Project/resources/Translations` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The translation files are specified in the CMake file. Initially, only `app_de.ts` and `app_en.ts` are included. To support additional languages, you will need to add the corresponding `.ts` files to the CMake configuration.

<br>

### Updating Translations
To update the translation files, use the following custom target:
```
_translations_update
```
<br>

---
<br>

### Compiling Translations
To compile the translation files, use the following custom target:
```
_translations_compile
```
<br><br><br>

## [Code Style and Linting]

This project uses `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` for code formatting and static analysis.

<br>

### Downloading clang-format and clang-tidy

To use `clang-format` and `clang-tidy`, download the appropriate precompiled binary from the [LLVM Release Page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html). Here are the recommended files based on your operating system:

- **Windows**: [clang+llvm-18.1.8-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.xz](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#18.1.8)
- **Linux**: [clang+llvm-18.1.8-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-18.04.tar.xz](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#18.1.8)
- **macOS**: [clang+llvm-18.1.8-arm64-apple-macos11.tar.xz](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#18.1.8)
<br>

---
<br>

### Configuration

To use `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` in your project, you need to set the following options in your CMake configuration:

- **USE_CLANG_FORMAT**: Enable this option to use `clang-format` for code formatting.
- **USE_CLANG_TIDY**: Enable this option to use `clang-tidy` for static analysis.
- **CLANG_TOOLS_PATH**: Specify the path to the `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` executables.
<br>

---
<br>

### Code Formatting

To format the C++ code and run static analysis, use the following custom targets:

```
_run_clang_format_project
_run_clang_tidy_project
```

To format the C++ code, run the following command after enabling the USE_CLANG_FORMAT option and specifying the path to clang-format:

```
cmake -DUSE_CLANG_FORMAT=ON -DCLANG_TOOLS_PATH="C:/path/to/clang+llvm-18.1.8-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/bin" ..
cmake --build . --target _run_clang_format_project
cmake --build . --target _run_clang_format_tests
```

To run static analysis with clang-tidy, ensure the USE_CLANG_TIDY option is enabled and the path to clang-tidy is specified:

```
cmake -DUSE_CLANG_TIDY=ON -DCLANG_TOOLS_PATH="C:/path/to/clang+llvm-18.1.8-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/bin" ..
cmake --build . --target _run_clang_tidy_project
cmake --build . --target _run_clang_tidy_tests
```
<br>

---
<br>

### Generating compile_commands.json

To use `clang-tidy`, you need to generate the `compile_commands.json` file. Run the `generate_compile_commands.sh` script to generate this file:
```
./Scripts/generate_compile_commands.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter the following error:
>
> Ninja Does not match the generator used previously..  Either remove the CMakeCache.txt file and CMakeFiles directory or choose a different binary directory.
>
> This error occurs if the build directory specified in the script already exists and was built with a different generator. Either remove the CMake cache or adjust the script to use a different(/new) build directory.
